# Gisella Nathania Lukman - Data & Business Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Gisella! I graduated with First Class Honours in Data Science and Business Analytics and have a strong foundation in both fields. I am passionate about using data to create meaningful insights that can drive business success. I bring a year of hands-on experience as a Business Analyst at PT Bank Digital BCA, where I refined my ability to analyze business processes and drive data-driven decisions. Additionally, I gained valuable experience during a two-month internship as a Data Scientist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk, where I worked on developing and implementing data models to solve complex business problems in a credit card fraud project. 

My background has equipped me with a strong analytical skill set, and I am eager to continue growing and applying my knowledge in the field of data science. I thrive in both collaborative and independent environments and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my expertise and take on challenging projects.

I'm currently working on my portfolio for my career and this repository will consist of my projects that I've done so far! I also attached my [resume](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/gisellanathaniaa/blob/main/CV%20Gisella%20Nathania%20Lukman.pdf) for detailed information.

# Portfolio Projects
## Testing and Implementing Data Model to Detect Credit Card Fraud

**Python Code:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine which data model is the best to detect credit card fraud in terms of precision and accuracy.

**Description:** This project focused on developing a robust model for detecting credit card fraud, with a primary goal of maximizing precision and accuracy. The dataset used in this project contained key transaction data, including masked customer IDs, transaction dates, transaction amounts, masked merchant IDs, and fraud status labels.

The project involved thorough data preprocessing and cleaning, including handling missing values, normalizing transaction amounts, and encoding categorical variables. Feature selection techniques were applied to identify the most relevant attributes for fraud detection, followed by the evaluation of various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Data visualization and simulation were also employed to gain insights and validate the model's effectiveness, ultimately identifying the best model in terms of precision and accuracy.

**Skills:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, features selection, encoding, data training, model selection, data modeling, data visualization, data simulation

**Python Library:** Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn

**Result:** Random forest model is tested to be the best among the 3 models to perform highly effectively with the most optimum precision and accuracy.


## Pregnancy Clothing E-Commerce Analysis and Wine Quality Clustering Analysis

**R Code:** [E-Commerce Analysis and Wine Quality.Rmd](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/E-Commerce%20Analysis%20and%20Wine%20Quality.Rmd)

**Goal:** To develop predictive modeling for pregnancy clothing prices and to classify wine qualities into a number of clusters.

**Description:** This project involved two key datasets: a pregnancy clothing e-commerce dataset and a wine quality dataset. For the pregnancy clothing dataset, the focus was on regression and classification to develop a predictive model for clothing prices and identify the model with the highest precision scoreâ€”critical for online retail. The wine quality dataset was used for unsupervised learning and to cluster wine qualities based on their similarities.

The data underwent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning, correlation analysis, and feature engineering. Algorithms were selected and models trained, followed by data visualization and evaluation using classification matrices. For the wine dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were employed to group the wines effectively.

**Skills:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, correlation matrix, algorithm selection, feature engineering, data training, data modeling, data visualization, classification matrix, principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering

**R Library:** tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, RColorBrewer, metrics, dplyr, plotly, psych, mlbench, CatEncoders, scales

**Result:** K-nearest Neighbour has the best performance in predicting the clothing price for both regression and classification methods as it has the highest precision score. Wine qualities are grouped into 3 clusters in terms of acidity, protein content, and taste.


## Flight Delay in 1995-1996 Analysis
**R Code:** [Flight Delay.Rmd](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Flight%20Delay%20Analysis.Rmd)

**Python Code:** [Flight Delay.ipynb](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Flight%20Delay.ipynb)

**Goal:** To develop a model that can predict plausible delay and to test the correlation and the accuracy of the variables.

**Description:** This project analyzed a 1995-1996 dataset on flight delays using regression methods to predict potential delays and understand customer behavior. The data underwent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning, feature engineering, and algorithm selection. Models were trained and evaluated, with data visualization and hypothesis testing used to validate findings, including the likelihood of plane delays and evolving customer behavior patterns.

**Skills:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, algorithm selection, feature engineering, data training, data modeling, data visualization

**Python Library:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn

**R Library:** tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly, psych, RColorBrewer

**Result:** The random forest model was the most accurate for predicting delays. Hypothesis testing showed that newer planes have more delays, and people's behavior changes over time. Through EDA, it is proven that flights in the early morning, on Saturdays, and in September are less likely to be delayed.


## Tesla Market Research Analysis
**Report:** [Tesla Market Research Analysis Report](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Tesla%20Market%20Research%20Report.pdf)

**Goal:** to provide more insights that will be able to boost Tesla sales and achieve its maximum profit, as well as to improve Tesla in several aspects

**Description:** This project focused on analyzing Tesla's market position and customer perceptions to support its customer acquisition and retention strategies, product expansion, and R&D budget reassessment. With Tesla's market share in electric vehicles is declining, the research aimed to provide insights to boost sales and maximize profits. The study explored drivers' attitudes toward electric cars, including price sensitivity, charging convenience, and driving range preferences. Additionally, it examined customer brand perceptions and interest in Tesla's upcoming products to identify market trends and inform strategic decisions.

**Skills:** Sampling techniques, discriminant analysis, ANOVA, paired t-test, focus group, chi-square test of homogeneity, multiple linear regression



## Sales Performance and Forecast Analysis
**Report:** [Sales Performance and Forecast Analysis Report](https://github.com/gisellanathaniaa/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Sales%20Perfomance%20and%20Forecast%20Analysis%20Report.pdf)

**Goal:** To analyze sales and convert it into actionable insights and provide strategic recommendations, as well as predicting the forecast sales.

**Description:** This project involved analyzing a company's performance data, including sales, profit, shipping costs, product lists, order data, and shipping data. Then, creating a comprehensive story using five Tableau dashboards, featuring bar charts, maps, pie charts, line charts, area charts, circle views, and dual combinations which will offer an in-depth analysis of overall sales, profit (with a focus on the US market), product categories, shipping costs, and future sales forecasts, helping to identify current trends and predict future performance.

**Skills:** Tableau
